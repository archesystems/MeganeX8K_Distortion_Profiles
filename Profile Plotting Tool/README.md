A Python script for plotting distortion profiles for comparison, created by Elo.

In line 8, change YOURUSERNAME to your Windows user name and place the distortion profiles in this folder.
Run the script to generate a plot (requires a python installation on your PC)

This tool uses the derivative of the profile curve to make the changes easy to see. 
Since the numerical difference is small between a point on one curve compared to another curve, this is a better way to evaluate them.
